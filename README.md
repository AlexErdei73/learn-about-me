# LEARN ABOUT ME

It is a mini social media app, which has been made in the book Express In Action
by Evan M. Hahn. The book is a great one, but a bit old. I have updated the code
with the newest versions of the libraries and used the alternatives instead of
depricated ones.

## Installation

1. Install MongoDB for your system from
   [MongoDB installation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)
   The database needs to be listening on localhost:27017/test .
2. Clone the repository
3. `cd learn-about-me` and `npm i` to install the dependancies.
4. `npm start` will start the app.js file, which is an Express app.
5. Open with your browser the [](http://localhost:3000).
